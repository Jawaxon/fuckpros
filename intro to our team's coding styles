Hello reader!
Welcome to the code of team 1898M, Medusa. Before you go on the journey of reading the code
that we have poured our time, caffine, and tears into let me clarify a few things about
our coding styles. As with most teens that spend all of their time building robots in a
basement we are... lets just say "quirky." This is evident in some of our naming systems
throught the code. Wheather that comes across in a very phoenetic spelling, or just a variable 
that gives us (and probably only us) joy. Our code is full of character, however, that does
not inhibit it's functionality or how easy it is to comprehend. I have gone through and
commented the entire project to both help my teammates read the code, and any team that
I may be helping. I find that as long as your code is structured well and commented thuroughly
having fun with your code makes the frustrating times feel a little more light hearted.
Many highfives,
-Your favorites Ars, Puck, and Hailey
